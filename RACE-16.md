**[Q1] Which of the following is an explanation of why `flashLoan()` could revert?** \
(A): The transaction reverts because a user requested to borrow more than `maxFlashLoan()` \
(B): The transaction reverts because the receiver’s `onFlashLoan()` did not return `CALLBACK_SUCCESS` \
(C): The transaction reverts because the user returned more than `retAmt` funds \
(D): The transaction reverts because a user tried to spend more funds than their allowance in `onFlashLoan()`

**[Q2] If the `FlashLoan` contract were safe, which of the following invariants should hold at the end of any given transaction for some ERC20 token t? Note: old(expr) evaluates expr at the beginning of the transaction.** \

(B): t.balanceOf(address(this)) == old(t.balanceOf(address(this))) \
(C): t.balanceOf(address(this)) > old(t.balanceOf(address(this))) \
(D): t.balanceOf(address(this)) == old(t.balanceOf(address(this))) + fee

**[Q8] Which of the following are guaranteed to hold after a successful (i.e., non-reverting) execution of `flashLoan()`, assuming the token for which the flashloan is requested uses OpenZeppelin’s Standard ERC20 implementation?** \
(A): The receiver’s balance of “token” increases \
(B): The funds that the `FlashLoan` contract has approved the `receiver` to spend has either stayed the same or decreased \
(C): The sum of all flashloans granted by the `FlashLoan` contract is less than the `maxFlashLoan` amount \
(D): The token balance of any contract/user other than the `FlashLoan` contract, the caller of the `flashLoan()`, and the “receiver” contract will remain the same as before the call to `flashLoan()`

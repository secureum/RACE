**[Q3] Gas will be saved with the following changes**

(A): Skipping initialization of counter variable  
(B): Making `increase()` function external to avoid copying from calldata to memory  
(C): Packing multiple implementation addresses into the same storage slot  
(D): Moving the calculation of the `counter()` function's signature hash to a constant

**[Q4] Calling the `increase()` function on the Proxy contract**

(A): Will revert since the Proxy contract has no `increase()` function  
(B): Will revert for any other caller than the one that deployed the Proxy  
(C): Increases the integer value in the Proxy's storage slot located at index 1  
(D): Delegate-calls to the zero-address

**[Q5] Calling the `decrease()` function on the Proxy contract**

(A): Will revert because it was not correctly registered on the proxy  
(B): Will succeed and return the value of counter after it was decreased  
(C): Will succeed and return the value of counter before it was decreased  
(D): Will succeed and return nothing

**[Q6] Due to a storage clash between the Proxy and the Mastercopy contracts**

(A): Proxy's `implementations` would be overwritten by 0 during initialization of the Mastercopy  
(B): Proxy's `implementations` would be overwritten when the counter variable changes  
(C): Proxy's `implementations` variable's storage slot being overwritten causes a DoS
